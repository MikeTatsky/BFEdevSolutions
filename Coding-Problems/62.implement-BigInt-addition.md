### Problem Description

Luckily we have [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) in JavaScript so handle big numbers.

What if we need to do it by ourselves for older browsers?

You are asked to implement a string addition function, **with all non-negative integers in string**.

```js
add('999999999999999999', '1');
// '1000000000000000000'
```

Don't use BigInt directly, it is not our goal here.

#

### Understanding the problem

We are given two non-negative numbers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string. We are asked to implement a function that is going to return the sum of the two numbers as a string. Converting the input strings directly to numbers is not allowed.

#

### Approach

We can add the two numbers digit by digit starting from the least significant digit. We would walk backwards through the two numbers simultaneously with the help of two pointers. At each step, we would add up the two digits that the two pointers are pointing at and insert the sum to the beginning of the resultant string. Since the sum of the two digits can be greater than or equal to `10`, we also need another variable to keep track of the carry. Therefore, instead of directly adding the sum of the two digits to our output string, we need to do the following:

1. First, we add the carry from the previous step to the sum of the two digits.

2. Then, we compute the carry for the next step and 'pop' the last digit off of the sum. To do this, we can use math:

   ```js
   // Compute the carry
   carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);

   // Pop the last digit off of the sum
   lastDigit = sum % 10;
   ```

3. Lastly, we add the last digit of the sum to the beginning of the resultant string.

Once we reached the beginning of both numbers, we check whether there is a carry from the last step, i.e. `carry > 0`. If that is the case, the carry needs to be added to the beginning of the resultant string before we return it. For instance, if the two numbers are `91` and `9`, when the loop terminates, the resultant string is going to be `00` and the carry is going to be `1`.

Since we are adding a digit to the beginning of the resultant string and we need to do this `max(num1.length, num2.length)` times, our algorithm would take O(N^2) time, where N is the maximum length of `num1` and `num2`. To optimize it, we could append the digits to the end of the resultant string and reverse the entire string before returning it. However, in most programming languages strings are immutable. That means every time we append a character to a string, a brand new string needs to be created, which is an O(N) operation. Calling `str += newChar` `N` times results in an O(N^2) time complexity ([In JavaScript, `+=` is optimized](https://josephmate.github.io/java/javascript/stringbuilder/2020/07/27/javascript-does-not-need-stringbuilder.html)). Therefore, a better way to collect the digits of the final sum is to use an array and store them in reverse order: `[last significant digit, ..., most significant digit]`, because inserting a value at the beginning of an array is an O(N) operation.

**Algorithm**

- Initialize a pointer `p1` to the end of `num1`.

- Initialize a pointer `p2` to the end of `num2`.

- Use a variable to keep track of the carry.

- Initialize an empty array `result` to hold the result.

- Loop backwards through the two numbers using the two pointers. The loop terminates when we reach the beginning of both numbers: `p1 >= 0 || p2 >= 0`.

  - Set `digit1` to the digit from `num1` at index `p1`. If `p1` has reached the beginning of `num1`, set `digit1` to `0`.

  - Set `digit2` to the digit from `num2` at index `p2`. If `p2` has reached the beginning of `num2`, set `digit2` to `0`.

  - Add `digit1`, `digit2` and the carry from the previous step up; store the result in a variable `sum`.

  - Update the carry: `carry = Math.floor(sum / 10)`.

  - Get the last digit of `sum` using `sum % 10` and append it to the `result` array.

- Now if the carry is still greater than `0`, push it into the `result` array.

- Reverse the `result` array. Join the reversed array into a string and return it.

### Implementation

```js
/**
 * @param {string} num1
 * @param {string} num2
 * @return {string}
 */
function add(num1, num2) {
  let p1 = num1.length - 1;
  let p2 = num2.length - 1;
  let carry = 0;
  const result = [];

  while (p1 >= 0 || p2 >= 0) {
    const digit1 = Number(num1[p1] ?? 0);
    const digit2 = Number(num2[p2] ?? 0);
    const sum = digit1 + digit2 + carry;

    carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);
    result.push(sum % 10);

    p1--;
    p2--;
  }

  if (carry > 0) result.push(carry);

  return result.reverse().join('');
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let N be the length of the first input number and M be the length of the second input number.

- Time Complexity: O(max(N, M)).

- Space Complexity: O(max(N, M)).
