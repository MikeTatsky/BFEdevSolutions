# 5. usePrevious()

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/react/usePrevious

#

### Problem Description

Create a hook `usePrevious()` to return the previous value, with initial value of `undefined.

#

### Solution

```tsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

export function usePrevious<T>(value: T): T | undefined {
  const preValueRef = useRef<T | undefined>();

  useEffect(() => {
    preValueRef.current = value;
  }, [value]);

  return preValueRef.current;
}
```

### Explanation

We are asked to create a hook that receives a new value and returns the previous one. It means we need to remember the old value before updating it with the new one. To do this, we leverage the fact that React's `useEffect` hook always runs after a render is painted to the screen. We use a React ref to store the previous value and set it to the new one in the `useEffect` hook, so that the update happens after the old value has been returned. The reason that we use React's `useRef` instead of `useState` is to avoid a re-render.

The hook can also be implemented without using the `useEffect` hook. We can just store the old value in a variable, and then set `preValueRef.current` to the new one.

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

export function usePrevious<T>(value: T): T | undefined {
  const preValueRef = useRef<T | undefined>();
  const temp = preValueRef.current;
  preValueRef.current = value;
  return temp;
}
```
